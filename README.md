# Introduction
This is just a fun project to make my own terminal look more vibrant and usable.
I have made a script for different shells that prints the name of the shell used
by the user.
It also lists the contents of the home directory.

## How to Use it
You can simply put it in you `.bashrc` so whenever you open your terminal it runs
the scripts.

I recommend putting it in your `.bashrc` or any other file you want to as follows:
```sh
bash $HOME/Splash-screen/main.sh
```

change the "bash" command with your own shell name (the scripts somehow doesn't work
if we use the "./" method)

## Use case
This script can be used as a splash screen or anything else you want to do.
You can also edit it to your liking to enhance what it does.

**NOTE:** I am not proficient in bash so I took some help of AI (not entirely but
to learn the concepts)
